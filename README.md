# E-Commerce Price Monitoring

> **A lightweight, educational scraper and analysis pipeline** for tracking product prices on demo e-commerce sites. Ideal for coursework, demonstrations, and learning web-scraping best practices.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains a compact, well-documented pipeline to collect, clean, analyze and visualize product price data from the demo site **Books to Scrape** ([http://books.toscrape.com/](http://books.toscrape.com/)). The goal is to provide a reproducible example of how to perform basic price monitoring in a polite, responsible way ‚Äî using Python, Pandas, and simple plotting.

The notebook and scripts are intentionally minimal so they are easy to run in **Google Colab** or locally, and to adapt for other educational datasets.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* Simple web-scraper that extracts **product title**, **price (GBP)** and **availability**.
* Light-weight, Colab-ready notebook structured into clear, copy-paste cells.
* Cleaned CSV output with a timestamped filename for reproducibility.
* Basic exploratory analysis: price buckets, aggregate summaries, and a clean bar chart.
* Clear instructions for deployment in Google Colab and options to save results to Google Drive.
* An explicit **Ethical Considerations** section to guide responsible use.

> *Note:* This repo ships with a small sample `clean_books_data.csv` so you can run the analysis cells immediately without running the scraper.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Run in Google Colab)

1. Open the notebook `notebooks/ecommerce_price_scraper_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload `clean_books_data.csv` to the Colab session (or mount your Google Drive).
3. Run the cells in order. The notebook includes a cell to optionally install any missing packages.

If you prefer to run locally, create a Python 3 virtual environment and install the basics:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib tqdm
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start (Colab)

1. **Install dependencies (optional)**

```bash
!pip install -q pandas matplotlib
```

2. **Upload `clean_books_data.csv`** into the Colab session (use the file upload GUI or mount Drive).
3. **Run the notebook cells**: load CSV ‚Üí clean ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí plot ‚Üí save `my_variant_clean_books.csv`.

The notebook is broken into small, copy-paste-ready cells so each step is visible and editable.

---

## üìä What the notebook produces

* A cleaned CSV file with a predictable name (eg. `my_variant_clean_books.csv`).
* A compact table of price buckets with counts, mean and median values.
* A single bar chart showing book counts per price bucket.

These outputs are intentionally modest so they are easy to inspect in class or in a code review.

---

## üß≠ How to Customize

* **Change price buckets**: modify the `bins` and `labels` arrays in the analysis cell.
* **Add more fields**: parse `rating`, `category` or follow product detail links to collect extended metadata.
* **Save to Drive**: mount Google Drive in Colab and set the output path to a Drive folder (persistent storage).
* **Run periodic monitoring**: wrap the scraper in a scheduler (cron or cloud function) ‚Äî only after obtaining permission from the target website.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they keep the project educational and accessible. Suggested contribution ideas:

* Improve data validation and unit tests.
* Add a small dashboard (Streamlit/Voila) for interactive exploration.
* Provide alternate dataset examples and more visualizations.

Please open an issue or submit a pull request ‚Äî keep changes small and well-documented.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

* This project uses **Books to Scrape**, a purpose-built demo site intended for learning web scraping. **It is safe and permissible to scrape.**
* **Do not** scrape production e-commerce websites (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) without explicit permission. Most commercial sites disallow automated scraping in their Terms of Service and may block or take legal action.
* Always respect `robots.txt` and implement **polite scraping** (rate limiting, retries, sensible User-Agent). If available, use official APIs.
* Avoid collecting or exposing sensitive personal or proprietary information. When sharing results, ensure you do not publish data that infringes copyright or privacy.
